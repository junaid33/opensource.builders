# Deep Research: Missing Open Source Alternatives

This document tracks proprietary software from our homepage carousel that currently lack open source alternatives in our database.

## Current Status
**✅ RESOLVED**: The API is working correctly on port 3003 with the proper open source directory schema. Frontend already configured to use correct endpoint.

## Database Status Analysis

## Research Process

For each software, we need to:

1. **Identify Core Features**: What makes this software valuable to users?
2. **Find Open Source Alternatives**: Research established open source projects that provide similar functionality
3. **Evaluate Alternatives**: Consider factors like:
   - Feature completeness
   - Active development and community
   - Documentation quality
   - Deployment options
   - Performance and scalability
4. **Create Database Entries**: Add both proprietary tool and open source alternatives to our database
5. **Establish Relationships**: Create alternative relationships with similarity scores
6. **Add Feature Mappings**: Map features between proprietary and open source tools

## Implementation Notes

- Ensure the correct GraphQL schema is running before adding data
- Use the existing database models: Tool, Category, Feature, Alternative, DeploymentOption
- Follow the established patterns in the codebase for creating alternatives
- Test each addition by verifying it appears in the homepage carousel results
