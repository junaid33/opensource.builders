                Opensource.Builders began in 2020 as a way to explore open
                source alternatives to popular proprietary applications. At that
                time there were many new projects gaining attention. Five years
                later, open source adoption is even stronger. Almost every
                proprietary application has at least one open source
                counterpart. The challenge is that deciding what counts as a
                true alternative is still highly subjective.

                Describing one application as an alternative to another often
                oversimplifies the reality. Consider Ghost, an open source
                blogging platform. You might call it an alternative to Shopify
                since both support blogging, yet Shopify also provides payment
                systems, product management, and storefronts that Ghost does
                not.

                To solve this, we focus on tracking features rather than vague
                comparisons. When you look at applications through the lens of
                features, you can see exactly where they overlap and where they
                differ. This perspective also shows how multiple open source
                projects can replace a single proprietary product. Proprietary
                tools often accumulate more features over time, but many of
                those additions are incomplete and fail to meet user
                expectations. By understanding features clearly, you can
                assemble a combination of open source projects that give you
                exactly what you need, while maintaining flexibility. If one
                project drops a feature, you can replace just that piece instead
                of being forced into an entirely new system.

                In the past, rewriting or refactoring software was often viewed
                as wasted effort. With the rise of AI, the cost of these tasks
                has fallen dramatically. Developers who understand a codebase
                well can now reimplement or improve entire sections more quickly
                and with greater confidence.

                Opensource.Builders supports this by doing more than simply
                listing which applications offer certain features. We also track
                where in the code those features live. This gives AI the context
                it needs to learn from working examples and then generate
                similar functionality for your environment. This is the idea
                behind the Build Drawer. You select the features you want from
                existing projects, and we create a structured prompt you can
                feed to the AI system of your choice. The AI then has a clear
                guide to help you bring those features into your own project.

                AI is not only changing the way software is built but also how
                people choose what software to use. Most users today still adapt
                themselves to whatever application they adopt. If they need a
                customization or a fix for an edge case, they must learn the
                application's API or extension system, which often creates
                deeper lock-in.

                AI is giving people the equivalent of a home kitchen. Instead of
                being stuck with takeout, you can now make something personal,
                tailored to your needs. We see Opensource.Builders as a
                cookbook. The recipes are open source projects, and our work is
                helping you understand and adapt them. Even if the results are
                not perfect, you have control over the process and can keep
                improving the outcome.

                Opensource.Builders is the companion to that vision. Each
                Openfront we build can stand on its own, but with our feature
                tracking and Build Drawer, businesses can go further. For
                example, if you run a barbershop and also want to sell
                merchandise, you can take e-commerce features from the retail
                Openfront and add them to the barbershop Openfront. The result
                is a personal platform that reflects your business exactly as
                you need it.

                My coding journey began about a year ago when I set out to build
                a tool to help manage my company. Like most people starting to
                learn how to code, I was drawn to Github and open-source
                software.

                After seeing (and starring) all these repos, the amount of time
                and effort these developers put into these projects was
                astounding. But what was the incentive? They were not getting
                paid and most profiles didn't even include the developer's real
                name or avatar.

                Then it dawned on me: these developers built these projects

                Most times, a commercial option was available, but these

                further accelerated this since more people could look at the

                Commercial software companies normally do not let you customize
                their software unless you go to the enterprise tier. With
                open-source, you can make the software adapt to your business as
                you scale and avoid vendor lock-in.

                Unlike commercial companies, open-source software is normally
                not funded, has little to no marketing budget, and is built by a
                single developer or small team. What makes it great is that it
                is a meritocracy. Its success is dependent on how good the
                software is and how much value it provides to users.
