## Implementation Strategy

1. **Database Insertion Order**:
   - Create proprietary Tool entries first
   - Create open source Tool entries
   - Create Alternative relationships
   - Map features between tools

2. **Feature Mapping Priority**:
   - Core functionality features first
   - Integration and deployment features
   - Advanced/premium features last

3. **Validation**:
   - Test each alternative relationship on frontend
   - Verify GitHub stars and URLs are current
   - Confirm deployment options are accurate
